So, for this fist a list of numbers from 2000 to 3200 was generated in \"i\" with the help of range function. And then, with the help of for loop and if statements the numbers in the list \"i\" were sorted and appended in another empty list \"m\". The numbers which were appended in the list \"m\" were sorted with if statements which were divisible by 7 but were not divisible by 5. "
